# RCPT
### Ready Check, Pull Timer

**RCPT** is a lightweight command-line World of Warcraft addon that helps raid leaders and dungeon organizers run smoother encounters. It automates the process of initiating a ready check, monitoring player responses, and triggering a pull timer when everyone is confirmed ready.

---

## üîß Features

- `/rcpt` triggers a **ready check**.
  - When all players are ready, it automatically starts a **pull timer**.
  - If not all players are ready, it will retry up to a configured number of times.
  - Players can **cancel the pull timer** by typing configured keywords in party or raid chat (e.g. "stop", "wait").

- Customize behaviors with easy slash commands.
